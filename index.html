  <h2>Hi! I'm currently a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Pittsburgh. Some of my courses this semester are Human Computer Interation and Privacy in the Electronic Society. I am thinking of pursuing a minor in Gender, Sex, & Women's Studies so I'm taking introductory courses for that program as well. I think that program will help me grow as a technology developer and help me create technology for everyone.</h2>
